# ISP: The Interface Segregation Principle

ISP stands for Interface Segregation Principle. It is one of the principles of Object-Oriented Design. Robert Cecil 
Martin¹ (widely known as Uncle Bob) introduces a number of principles in his famous book:

[Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Development-Principles-Patterns-Practices/dp/0135974445)

He describes five OOD principles in this book. They are collectively known as the SOLID Principles. These principles 
have received wide attention in the software industry. The Interface Segregation Principle is the fourth one of the 
five principles. Otherwise, “I” of SOLID.

Uncle Bob gives a definition of the Interface Segregation Principle in his book. The definition is as the following:

> Clients should not be forced to depend on methods that they do not use.

What does the definition mean? This means that when client classes are forced to depend on methods that they do **NOT** 
use, then those client classes are subject to changes to those methods.

If such a thing happens, then client classes need to degenerate those useless methods, but degenerating methods violate 
the Liskov Substitution Principle. We should avoid such couplings where possible. Let us dig into ISP.

Imagine, we need a simple notification system that will notify users via Email or SMS. As you know, there is an 
object-oriented design principle called —

> Program to an interface, not an implementation.

The interface actually represents abstraction. Some languages have this feature like PHP, JAVA, etc. When we use 
interface, we actually represent an abstraction. So ‘Program to an interface’ actually means ‘program to a supertype’. 
Generally, the supertype is represented via an interface or an abstract class. Keep it in mind, interface and abstract 
both features represent abstractions.

So we would program to an interface to represent an abstraction, therefore, a supertype. For our notification system, 
we need an interface, therefore, an abstraction representing how we can deal with notifications. Here is our 
Notification interface:

```php
<?php 

interface NotificationInterface
{
    /**
     * Sends emails
     * 
     * @param array $data
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function sendEmail(array $data);

    /**
     * Sends SMSs
     * 
     * @param array $data
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function sendSms(array $data);
}
```
What is going on in the code above? According to our demand, we have made an abstraction for our notification system. 
It has two abstract methods - `sendEmail()`, and `sendSms()`.

**Remember that an interface dictates that its subclasses must implement those methods declared in it.**

As PHP supports interface, so we make this example code using interface. But we could do this using an abstract class 
too as below:

```php
<?php

abstract class AbstractNotification
{
    /**
     * Sends emails
     *
     * @param array $data
     * @return mixed
     */
    abstract public function sendEmail(array $data);

    /**
     * Sends SMSs
     *
     * @param array $data
     * @return mixed
     */
    abstract public function sendSms(array $data);
}
```
Now we would check whether the `Notification` interface or abstraction conforms to ISP or not. How would we know that? 
Well, when we would create some derivative classes from the `Notification` interface, then we would be able to see the 
problem actually.

## Interface Pollution
Here we will use **ABC Email**, for example, the email sender service for sending emails to the users. So we need to 
create a client class implementing the `Notification` interface. This client class will be used for sending emails. 
Look at the code below:

```php
<?php

class AbcEmailClient implements NotificationInterface
{
    /**
     * Sends emails via SMTP
     *
     * @param array $data
     * @return mixed
     */    
    public function sendEmail(array $data) 
    {
        // TODO: Implement sendEmail() method via SMTP
    }
    
    // SMTPClient is being forced to implement this method
    public function sendSms(array $data) 
    {
        // Degeneration of sendSms() method
    }    
}
```
As you can see we are implementing the `Notification` interface, so have to implement methods that the interface 
dictates. We did it so in the code above. We implemented `AbcEmailClient::sendEmail()` to send emails. Moreover, we 
had to degenerate a method called `AbcEmailClient::sendSms()`. Notice, our purpose is to only send emails using 
**ABC Email** the email sender service. Sending SMS is not the task that the `AbcEmailClient` has to do in this case.

If we made a client class for sending SMS, `XyzSmsClient` SMS sender service, for example, that would have to degenerate 
a method also like `XyzSmsClient::sendEmail()`.

This is an example of interface pollution. That means our Notification interface design has low cohesion. 
Meaning it has a set of unrelated methods. The `sendEmail()` method sends emails while the `sendSms()` method sends 
SMSs. Both methods have different tasks. So, their purposes are quite different. That is why they are unrelated.

In the code above, client classes are forced to degenerate methods that they do not need. Doing so `Notification` 
interface violates the ISP. Well, what is the solution then? As we have a low cohesive interface, therefore, the 
interface has a set of unrelated methods, we need to break the interface into groups to achieve high cohesion, 
therefore, interface with deeply related methods.

## Separate Interfaces
When we go to implement our `Notification` interface design, we have then seen that we need to deal with two different 
clients — `AbcEmailClient` and `XyzSmsClient`. Separate clients mean separate interfaces. Let us break the design 
currently we have.

Interface for sending emails:

```php
<?php

interface EmailNotificationInterface
{
    /**
     * Sends emails
     * 
     * @param array $data
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function send(array $data);
}
```

Interface for sending SMSs:

```php
<?php

interface SmsNotificationInterface
{
    /**
     * Sends SMSs
     * 
     * @param array $data
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function send(array $data);
}
```

Now, we have two separate interfaces. We can implement them with different client classes. No client class will be 
forced anymore to use methods that the client does not use. **Keep it in mind, separating interfaces does NOT mean 
that each interface will contain a single method to be implemented**. So an interface can have more than one single 
method but those methods must be highly related, otherwise, the interface may violate ISP.

Now we would create a client class and try to fake sending emails. Let us do it:

```php
<?php

class AbcEmailClient implements EmailNotificationInterface
{
    /**
     * Sends emails via ABC Email service
     *
     * @param array $data
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function send(array $data)
    {
        // TODO: Implement send() method.
    }
}
```

Here we create a client class that implements `EmailNotification` interface. This time our client class is not being 
forced to use methods that are unrelated to it. Though we have one method to implement in this case, we could have 
been more related methods. Keep it in mind related methods may not force a client class to be implemented that the 
client does not need.

```php
<?php

class EmailNotifier implements NotifierInterface
{
    /**
     * @param array $data
     * @param EmailNotificationInterface $notifier
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function notify(array $data, EmailNotificationInterface $notifier)
    {
        return $notifier->send($data);
    }
}


// Prepares email client
$abcEmail = new AbcEmailClient();

// Prepares data for sending email
$data = [
    // data...
];

// Notifies users via emails
$emailNotification = new EmailNotifier();
$emailNotification->notify($data, $abcEmail);
```

So this is one way of respecting ISP. How we did that is explained above. But I would like to show you some UML 
diagrams so that you can grasp all the things described above at a glance.

Our first design was not ISP compatible. In UML diagram, that looks like the below:

![ISP incompatible UML diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unclexo/software-craftsman/main/assets/solid/isp/isp-incompatible-uml-diagram.png)

But to be compatible with ISP what we did in the explanation above looks like the following UML diagram:

![ISP compatible UML diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unclexo/software-craftsman/main/assets/solid/isp/isp-compatible-uml-diagram.png)

ISP deals with the disadvantages of fat interfaces. Therefore, classes that have fat interfaces have low-cohesion. 
In other words, the interfaces of the class can be broken up into groups of methods. Thereby, each group represents 
a different set of clients. Thus, some clients use one group of member functions, and other clients use the other 
groups.
